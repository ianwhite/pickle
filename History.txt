== 0.2.4 - 9 Mar 2010

* 1 major improvement
  * Finding models via a table now works in the same way as creating models via a table (0.2.3), you
    can create pickle refs

== 0.2.3 - 9 Mar 2010

* 1 major improvement
  * You can now use pickle refs in tables.  If you add a column which is the single factory name, the
    contents of the column will be used as the pickle ref.  [Stephan Hagemann]
    e.g.
      Given the following users exist:
        | user | name        | status |
        | jack | Jack Spratt | alone  |
        | pete | Pete Sprong | dead   |

== 0.2.0 - 24 Nov 2009

* 4 major improvements
  * Added support for finding models using tables
    Example:
      Then the following users should exist:
        | name  |
        | Fred  |
        | Ethel |
      And the 1st user should be male
      And the 2nd user should be female
      
  * tables now support pickle refs in cells (see features/pickle/create_from_factory_girl.rb#37)
  
  * features/support/email.rb adds an email helper for mapping names to email addresses (similar to NavigationHelper in paths.rb)
  
  * Added ability for path_to_pickle to handle arbitrary segments
    Example:
      path_to_pickle('account', 'the enquiry') => account_enquiry_path(<enquiry>)

* 2 minor improvements
  * fail faster in pickle steps when a pickle ref can't be found, by using model! in most places

  * generated pickle steps are less picky about possessives so that pickle mappings accepted in more places
    e.g. when you have
        config.map 'my', 'I', 'myself', :to => 'user: "me"'
      you can now do
        Given I exist
        ...
        Then the project should be one of my assigned projects
