Mongoid adapter, fallback ORM adapter for those not using machinist or active_record, bugfixes

* 2 major improvements
  * adapter for Mongoid [Sebastian Zuchmanski]
  * replace ActiveRecord 'factory' adapter with Orm adapter.
  
      If you don't have machinist or factory_girl, the Orm factory adapter will fallback to your Orm to create classes.
      
      BC: if you have a line like this:
        Pickle.configure do |config|
          config.adapters = [:active_record]
        end

      You need to replace it with :orm

* 2 minor improvements
  * fail faster in pickle steps when a pickle ref can't be found, by using model! in most places

  * generated pickle steps are less picky about possessives so that pickle mappings accepted in more places
    e.g. when you have
        config.map 'my', 'I', 'myself', :to => 'user: "me"'
      you can now do
        Given I exist
        ...
        Then the project should be one of my assigned projects

    email steps allow you to do things like this:

      And the 2nd email should be delivered to the user: "ethel"
